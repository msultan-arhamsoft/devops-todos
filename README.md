# Devops Project Backend
This is the backend repo of the project created for DevOps training. The backend is written in NodeJs and is connected to MongoDB database. This is a simple Todo API backend.
In order to make the backend up and running do the following:
- Create a .env file at the root of the project.
- Copy the .env.example file's content in the .env file created in the previous step.
- Run the command `docker-compose up`. It will pull the images from docker hub and start the micro services for backend and mongodb.
- The backend application will be connected to the database.
- Visit the http://localhost:8080 and you should see the default page of the backend.
